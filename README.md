# Robotics with Pololu Romi

Comprehensive collection of robot simulation, control, and visualization tools for the Pololu Romi robot platform. Includes Arduino firmware, C++ Qt applications, and Python simulations for forward/inverse kinematics, motor control, and waypoint navigation.

## Overview

This repository provides a complete software stack for the Pololu Romi 32U4 robot, covering multiple implementation approaches and use cases:

- **Arduino Firmware**: Low-level robot control with PID-based motion control, supporting both serial and I2C communication protocols
- **C++ Qt Applications**: Desktop applications with OpenGL visualization for robot control, simulation, and monitoring
- **Python Simulations**: Interactive simulations using PySide6 and OpenGL for algorithm development and testing
- **PyBullet Simulations**: Physics-based simulations using PyBullet for realistic robot motion, camera visualization, and stadium environments
- **ROS2/Gazebo Integration**: ROS2 plugins and Gazebo simulation for integration with the ROS ecosystem
- **Docker Environment**: Containerized ROS2 and Gazebo setup for reproducible development environments

All projects share common robot parameters and control algorithms, allowing seamless transition between simulation and hardware deployment.

## Features

### Simulations
- ✅ Forward kinematics with odometry drift visualization
- ✅ Inverse kinematics with waypoint navigation
- ✅ Realistic motor dynamics (second-order model)
- ✅ Encoder noise simulation (Gaussian noise)
- ✅ PID velocity control with anti-windup

### Controls
- ✅ Virtual joystick interfaces (multi-touch enabled)
- ✅ Gamepad support (physical controllers)
- ✅ Waypoint click-to-add functionality
- ✅ Real-time trajectory visualization

### Communication
- ✅ Serial communication (Arduino ↔ PC) - ASCII command protocol
- ✅ Network communication (TCP/IP between inverse_kinematics_app/sim_app and inverse_kinematics_viewer)
- ✅ Human-readable text commands for easy debugging and manual control

### OpenGL-Based UI
- ✅ **Resolution Independent**: All C++ Qt visualizations (forward/inverse kinematics) use OpenGL for scalable rendering
- ✅ **Current Implementation**: 2D geometry rendering (robot trajectories, waypoints, grid)
- 🚧 **Future Enhancements**: 
  - Support for 3D model loading (STL/OBJ file formats)
  - 3D world environments for more realistic visualization
  - Enhanced spatial representation with depth perception

**Benefits of OpenGL Approach:**
- Smooth rendering at any resolution or zoom level
- Hardware-accelerated graphics performance
- Easy integration of future 3D features
- Cross-platform graphics consistency
